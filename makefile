# This is a comment.
# Important: You *must* indent using <TAB>s, not spaces.

#
# General syntax:
#   targets : prerequisites; recipes
#   <TAB>recipe
#
# - Commands starting with
#     "-" are ignoring their exit-code.
#     "@" do not echo the command itself.
#
# - make starts a new shell process for each recipe line.
#   Thus shell variables, even exported environment variables, cannot propagate upwards.
#   Therefore better concatenate your multiline-commands with ";\" into a single line.
